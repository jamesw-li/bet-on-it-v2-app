Version: 1.0

1. Introduction
Bet On It is a social mobile application designed to increase engagement and add a layer of friendly competition to any social gathering. The app allows a host or organizer to create an event where attendees can place bets on various moments and outcomesâ€”from predicting the winner of a board game to guessing the final score of a live sports match. The app serves as a dynamic icebreaker, encouraging interaction and creating a more memorable experience for everyone involved, no matter the occasion.

This document details the product requirements for the initial release of Bet On It, which will be a fully functioning application for both iOS and Android.

2. Vision & Mission
Vision: To become the go-to entertainment app for any social event, transforming passive attendance into active and memorable participation.

Mission: To provide a seamless, fun, and user-friendly platform for friends and guests to connect and compete through friendly wagers, making every moment of any event more engaging.

3. Target Audience
Primary Users: Socially active individuals, typically aged 21-50, who are tech-savvy and enjoy games, friendly competition, and interacting at social events (e.g., game nights, birthday parties, holiday gatherings, fantasy sports drafts, vacation trips).

Secondary Users (Event Creators): Anyone hosting a social event who wants to provide unique and interactive entertainment for their guests.

4. Core Features & User Stories
The app's functionality is broken down into the following core features, expressed as user stories.

4.1. User Account Management
As a new user, I want to be able to sign up for an account using my email or social logins (Google, Apple) for quick access.

As a returning user, I want to log in to my account easily.

As a user, I want to have a simple profile with my name, a profile picture, and my username for a preferred payment app (e.g., Venmo, PayPal) to facilitate easy payouts outside the app.

4.2. Event Creation & Management
As a host or organizer, I want to create a new "Event" by providing essential details like the event name, date, and a welcome message.

As an organizer, I want to generate a unique and shareable event code or QR code to easily invite guests.

As an organizer, I want the ability to assign a "Co-Host" role to a guest who can help manage the bets during the event.

As an organizer, I want to be able to close the event, which finalizes all bets and calculates the final leaderboard.

4.3. Bet Creation & Participation
As an organizer, I want to choose from a curated list of popular, pre-made bet templates categorized by event type (e.g., for a game night: "Who will win the first game?"; for a sports viewing party: "What will the final score be?").

As an organizer, I want the ability to create my own custom bets with unique questions and multiple-choice answers.

As a guest, I want to use the event code or QR code to find and join a specific event.

As a guest, I want to view a list of all active bets for the event.

As a guest, I want to place my wager on the outcome I predict for each bet.

4.4. Live Event & Payouts
As a user, I want to see a real-time leaderboard that updates as bets are settled, showing rankings and potential winnings.

As an organizer or co-host, I want to "call" (i.e., settle) each bet by selecting the correct outcome once it has occurred.

As a user, when the event is over, I want to see a final summary screen that clearly states who owes whom and how much.

As a user, I want to easily access the payment information (e.g., Venmo username) of the users I need to pay.

Disclaimer: The application will not handle any real-money transactions. Its sole purpose is to track bets and calculate who owes what. All financial settlements must be handled by users outside of the Bet On It app. A clear disclaimer must be visible within the app.

5. Monetization Model
The app will generate revenue through a "freemium" event model:

Free Tier: Organizers can create an event with up to 5 bets and 10 guests for free. This allows users to try the app's core functionality.

Premium Event Purchase (One-Time Fee): For a one-time fee (e.g., $29.99), the organizer can upgrade their event to "Premium," which includes:

Unlimited guests.

Unlimited custom bets.

The ability to assign a Co-Host.

Split the Pot Feature: The option to designate a percentage of the premium fee to be awarded to the event's overall winner, managed by the host.

6. Technical Specifications
Platform: Cross-platform (iOS and Android).

Frontend Framework: Expo Go (Version 54) / React Native. The app must be fully compatible with the latest version of the Expo Go app for development and testing.

Backend as a Service (BaaS): Supabase.

Database: Supabase Postgres for storing user profiles, events, bets, and user wagers.

Authentication: Supabase Auth for managing user sign-up, login (including email/password, Google, and Apple OAuth).

Real-time Functionality: Supabase Realtime Subscriptions to power live leaderboards and instant updates as bets are called.

Storage: Supabase Storage for hosting user-uploaded profile pictures.

Push Notifications: Expo Push Notifications for alerting users when bets are settled or when they win.

7. Design & User Experience (UX/UI)
Aesthetic: The app should be clean, modern, and fun, with a vibrant and versatile look that feels appropriate for any social gathering. Avoid a cluttered or "casino-like" appearance.

Onboarding: The user onboarding process should be simple and intuitive, quickly guiding new users through joining or creating an event.

Usability: The process of placing bets, tracking progress, and viewing results must be straightforward and require minimal effort from the user.

Accessibility: The app should adhere to standard accessibility guidelines to be usable by as many guests as possible.
